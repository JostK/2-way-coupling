====== WAVE FRAME WORK ======

This wave generation and absorption framework is initially developed by
Niels G. Jacobsen from the Technical University of Denmark. The method
and its validation has been published in

@article { jacobsenFuhrmanFredsoe2012,
    Author = {Jacobsen, N G and Fuhrman, D R and Freds\o{}e, J},
    Title = {{A Wave Generation Toolbox for the Open-Source CFD Library: OpenFoam\textregistered{}}},
    Journal = {{Int. J. for Numer. Meth. Fluids}},
    Year = {2012},
    Volume = {70},
    Number = {9},
    Pages = {1073-1088},
    DOI = {{10.1002/fld.2726}},
}

Please make proper reference to this article, when the work is used. Note that the pre-print year was
2011, however, the paper was not published until 2012.

====== POROSITY MODULE ======

The porosity module was developed by Bjarne Jensen (TU Denmark) and
Niels G. Jacobsen (TU Denmark/Deltares). The implementation is
described and tested for coastal engineering problems in:

@article{Jensen2014,
    Author = {Jensen, Bjarne and Jacobsen, Niels Gj\o{}l and Christensen, Erik Damgaard},
    Journal = {Coastal Engineering},
    Pages = {56--72},
    Publisher = {Elsevier B.V.},
    Title = {{Investigations on the porous media equations and resistance coefficients for coastal structures}},
    Volume = {84},
    Year = {2014},
}

Note that a prober calibration of the resistance coefficients are
also presented in this paper. Available at: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378383913001816
