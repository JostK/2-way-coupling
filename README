===== INSTALLATION =====

1. Make sure that Gnu Scientific Library is installed, e.g. using the Package Manager system
   Examples (from http://lavandula.imim.es/adun-new/?page_id=186)

   Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
   Fedora: sudo yum install gsl-devel
   Suse:   sudo zypper install gsl-devel

2. Type './Allwmake' in the command line

3. For versions later than 1.7, please refer to the wiki on how to modify interFoam -> waveFoam.

===== DOCUMENTATION =====

The following paper describes the implementation of boundary conditions, the relaxation zones 
and the framework for relaxationShapes:
