1. Requirements
-----------------
OceanWave3D requires the following third-party software libraries:
 * A Fortran compiler (e.g. gfortran, ifort, absoft, etc.)
 * Software libraries
	- Harwell Subroutine Library
	- LAPACK
	- SPARSKIT2
 * For Visualization (CURRENTLY NOT USED DUE TO PORTABILITY PROBLEMS)
        - LIB_VTK_IO (GPL V3 lisense)

2. Installation
-----------------

For building the binary executable, proceed as follows:

Unix-based clients:
 * Set the variable INSTALLDIR in 'common.mk' to a directory in your path
   or accept the default path '$HOME/bin'
 * Set the variable FC to your system fortran compiler name.  This choice sets 
   up the desired compiler options and library paths, if none of the existing 
   choices matches your system, create a new compiler command and set-up block.  
   $> emacs common.mk
 * Compile third-party libraries mentioned in Requirements section and make
   sure that they are accessible in the include paths used in common.mk.
 * From the OceanWave3D top directory use 'make' to build the OceanWave3D package
   $> make
 * To run an example problem, create a new directory, fx
   $> mkdir $HOME/OW3D_test
 * Change to the OceanWave3D root directory and copy an example input file to the test directory
   $> cp trunk/examples/inputfiles/Whalin3D.inp $HOME/OW3D_test/Whalin3D.inp
 * Then execute in the 'OW3D_test' directory
   $> cd $HOME/OW3D_test
   If the OceanWave3D binary is in the PATH then type
   $> OceanWave3D Whalin3D.inp
   or else if the default path was accepted use
   $> $HOME/bin/OceanWave3D Whalin3D.inp
   to generate output from test case.

3. Project Layout
-----------------

The OceanWave3D contains a distributed set of source files with the following directory tree layout:

A GPU-accelerated massively parallel version of OceanWave3D has been proto-typed that can execute on heterogenous archictures using the CUDA programming model has been developed in collaboration between Morten Gorm Madsen (first proof-of-concept version), Stefan Lemvig Glimberg (advanced version within GPULAB library) and Allan P. Engsig-Karup. In this version of the code the multigrid preconditioned defect correction method (PDC) appeared for the first time and it accessbile in this fortran version of the code as well.
