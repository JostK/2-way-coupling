!!I am very grateful to Renato N. Elias: whitout his support \LIBVTKIO would not born. As a matter of facts \LIBVTKIO is a
!!collection of his tips. Despite the fact that Renato does not write the code he is a \virgo{moral co-author} of the code.
!!
!!I thank Enrico Cavallini for his help in debugging the code. He also develop the MS Windows version
!!of \LIBVTKIO and he is the first co-author that I found.
!!
!!Finally I thank the ParaView mailing list for the great support of its members.
