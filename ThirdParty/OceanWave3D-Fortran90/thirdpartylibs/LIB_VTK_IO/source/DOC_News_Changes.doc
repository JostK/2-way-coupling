!!\section*{Version v0.2}
!!\lettrine[lines=2,loversize=-.1,lraise=0.2]{{\bf T}}{he} version v0.2 is the second testing release. From version v0.1 there are
!!only minor changes; this new version does not introduce new features and does not fix bugs: it is a simple code-cleaning. The
!!character variables are now case-insensitive; the names of some variables have been changed. The comments have been translated in
!!English (very poor translation...).
!!
!!\begin{boxred}{List of changes from v0.1}
!!\begin{enumerate1Red}
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}formato} is changed in {\color{Maroon}output\_format} and now appears only in VTK\_INI and
!!        in VTK\_INI\_XML.
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}nomefile} is changed in {\color{Maroon}filename}.
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}titolo} is changed in {\color{Maroon}title}.
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}topologia} is changed in {\color{Maroon}mesh\_topology} and now appears only in VTK\_INI and
!!        in VTK\_INI\_XML.
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}NCelle} is changed in {\color{Maroon}NC}.
!!  \item variable {\color{Maroon}Nnodi} is changed in {\color{Maroon}NN}.

!!The only relevant news in the v0.2 version is about this guide: now the guide is integrated in the code. The code has particular
!!comments: if the code is processed by the program FortranDOC\footnote{FortranDOC is an open-source fortran code available at:
!!\href{http://stefano.zaghi.googlepages.com/fortrandoc}{http://stefano.zaghi.googlepages.com/fortrandoc}. This code processing a
!!free-format fortran code generates a corresponding pretty-latex documentation file of the code structure.} a latex source of
!!this guide will be made; compiling the latex file with \virgo{pdflatex} you will obtain this guide in PDF.
