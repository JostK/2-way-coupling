!!\lettrine[lines=2,loversize=-.1,lraise=0.2]{{\bf L}}{IB\_VTK\_IO} is a Fortran library to write and read
!!(actually only to write) data conforming the VTK standard both binary and ascii. Even though there are many
!!wrappers/porting of the VTK source code (C++ code), there is not a fortran one. This library is not a porting
!!or a wrapper of the VTK code, but it only an exporter/importer of the VTK data format written in pure fortran
!!language (standard Fortran 95 with some extensions of non standard Fortran 2003) that can be used by fortran
!!coders (yes, there are still a lot of these brave coders...) without mixing fortran with C++ language.
!!
!!The library is still in developing and testing, this is first usable release, but there are not all the features
!!of the stable release (the importer is totaly absent and the exporter is not complete). Surely there are a lot of
!!bugs and the progamming style is not the best, but the exporter is usable for the 90\% of the VTK data format.
!!
!!The \LIBVTKIO is an open source project, it is distribuited under the GPL v3 (see appendix \ref{cap:GPL}). Anyone is
!!interest to use, to develop or contribuite to \LIBVTKIO is welcome.

!!\label{sec:VTK Standard}
!!VTK, Visualization Toolkit, is an open source software that provides a powerful framework for the computer grafich, for
!!the images processing and for 3D rendering. It is widely used in the world and so it has a very large comunity of users;
!!besides the Kitware\footnote{The Kitware homepage can be found here: \href{http://public.kitware.com}{http://public.kitware.com}.}
!!company provides professional support. The toolkit is written in C++ and a lot of porting/wrappers for Tcl/Tk,
!!Java and Python are provided; unlucky there aren't wrappers for Fortran.
!!
!!Because of its good features the VTK toolkit has been used to develop a large set of open source programs. For my work
!!the most important family of programs is the scientific visualization programs. A lot of high-quality scientific visualization
!!tool are available on the web but for me the best is ParaView: I think that it is one of the best scintific visualization
!!program in the world and it is open source! Paraview is based on VTK.

!!\label{sec:Paraview}
!!ParaView\footnote{The ParaView homepage can be found here: \href{http://www.paraview.org}{http://www.paraview.org}.}
!!is an open source software voted to scientific visualization and able to use the power of parallel architectures. It
!!has an architecture client-server in order to make easy the remote visualization of very large set of data. Because it is based
!!on VTK it inherits all VTK features. ParaView is very useful for Computational Fluid Dynamics visualizations because it provides
!!powerful post-processing tools; it provides a very large set of importers for the most used format like Plot3D and HDF (the list
!!is very large). It is easy to extend ParaView because it supports all the scripting language supported by VTK.

!!\section*{LIB\_VTK\_IO}
!!\label{sec:LIB_VTK_IO}
!!Even though the VTK toolkit is written in C++ and so it is possible to use it in mixed fortran/c++ code this is not the easiest
!!way. Fortran is still the best language for high performance computing for scientific purpose, like CFD computing. It necessary a
!!tool to deal with VTK standard directly by fortran code. The library \LIBVTKIO was made to fill this empty: it is a simple
!!fortran module able to export native fortran data into VTK data format and to import VTK data into a fortran code (actually this
!!feature is missing), both in ascii and binary file format.
!!
!!The library provides an automatic way to deal with VTK data format: all the formatting processes is nested into the library and
!!the users comunicate with it by a simple API passing only native fortran data (native fortran scalar, vector and matrix).
!!
!!The library \LIBVTKIO is distribuited under the GNU GPL v3 license (see appendix \ref{cap:GPL}). Beyond to the source code there
!!are some precompiled binaries for GNU-Linux (amd x86, amd x86\_64, intel x86, intel x86\_64) and WindowsXP (amd x86, intel x86).
!!
!!Actually the library is still in developing/testing phase (a lot of features are missing); this is not a stable release, but the
!!exporter is quite complete and its API is quite stable. The exporter is usable and I use it for my work.
