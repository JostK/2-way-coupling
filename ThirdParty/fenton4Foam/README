Stream function theory programs.

These programs are based on the paper of Fenton (1988). 

J.D. Fenton (1988) The numerical solution of steady water wave problems
Computers and Geosciences vol 14(3), pp 357-368.

The code was given directly in an appendix to the paper. Jesper Skourup 
(DHI) typed it in and it was later ammended by Harry Bingham (DTU).

fenton.orig.f : original fenton program. From Harry Bingham
fenton.f.from.harry : Harry's modified version. Some improvements on 
allocation and different output. 
fenton.f : My modification of Harry's fenton.f. Change of output as the 
only thing.
fft.f : fft routine needed.


Compile by ifc -o fenton fenton.f fft.f

============================================================
The mentioned files are not distributed with waves2Foam. The
only difference between the last version modified by Henrik 
Bredmose and the present version is that the present version
writes the necessary coefficients into an OpenFoam dictionary
format.
