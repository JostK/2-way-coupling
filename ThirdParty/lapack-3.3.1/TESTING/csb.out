 Tests of CHBTRD
 (reduction of a Hermitian band matrix to real tridiagonal form)

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         5    20
    N:         5    20
    K:         0     1     2     5    16

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 CHB routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 38 tests done)

 All tests for CHB passed the threshold (  540 tests run)


 End of tests
 Total time used =         0.05 seconds
