 Tests of DSBTRD
 (reduction of a symmetric band matrix to tridiagonal form)

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         5    20
    N:         5    20
    K:         0     1     2     5    16

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 DSB routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 36 tests done)

 All tests for DSB passed the threshold (  540 tests run)
