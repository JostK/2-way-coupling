 Tests of the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    NB:        1     3     3     3    10
    NBMIN:     2     2     2     2     2
    NX:        1     0     5     9     1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   50.00


 DST routines passed the tests of the error exits (147 tests done)


 SEP:  NB =   1, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DST passed the threshold ( 4662 tests run)

 All tests for DST drivers  passed the threshold ( 14256 tests run)


 SEP:  NB =   3, NBMIN =   2, NX =   0
