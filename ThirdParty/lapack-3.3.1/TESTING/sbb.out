 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00



 SBB:  NRHS =   1

 All tests for SBB passed the threshold ( 3000 tests run)


 SBB:  NRHS =   2

 All tests for SBB passed the threshold ( 3000 tests run)
