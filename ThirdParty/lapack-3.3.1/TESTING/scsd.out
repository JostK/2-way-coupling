 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0    10    10    10    10    21    24    30    22    32

    P:         0     4     4     0    10     9    10    20    12    12

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   10.00


 CSD routines passed the tests of the error exits (  0 tests done)

 All tests for CSD routines passed the threshold (   270 tests run)
