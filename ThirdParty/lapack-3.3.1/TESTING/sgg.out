 Tests of the Generalized Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    NB:        1     1     2     2
    NBMIN:    40    40     2     2
    NS:        2     4     2     4
    MAXB:     40    40     2     2
    NBCOL:    40    40     2     2

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00
