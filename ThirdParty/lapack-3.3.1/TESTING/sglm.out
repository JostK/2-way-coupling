 Tests of the Generalized Linear Regression Model routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     5     8    15    20    40
    P:         9     0    15    12    15    30
    N:         5     5    10    25    30    40

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 GLM routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for GLM routines passed the threshold (    48 tests run)
