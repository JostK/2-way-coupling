 Tests of the REAL LAPACK RFP routines 
 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    N   :       0     1     2     3     5     6    10    11    50
    NRHS:       1     2    15
    TYPE:       1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   30.00

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549D-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282D+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046D-07
