Test case: couplingOceanWave3D
=========================================

This test case is a copy of the standard
waveFlume test case. The only difference
is that the generated wave is based on 
the nonlinear Laplace solver for wave 
propagation: OceanWave3D.

The wave generated at the inlet is based
on stream function wave theory. Note that
the computational domain has been shifted
slightly to the right in comparison with
the waveFlume case.
